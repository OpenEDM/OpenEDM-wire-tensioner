# OpenEDM-wire-tensioner

This repository contains the design of the **Wire tensioning mechanism**, in particular, hardware design and firmware. Note that this design is a work in progress, it is not complete, and may contain errors

Currently, the electronic hardware is assembled from heavily customized standard modules, as shown in the image below. An integrated hardware design is available in the [Hardware](https://github.com/OpenEDM/OpenEDM-wire-tensioner/tree/main/Hardware) directory, but it is still in the early stages of development

The mechanical design of the wire tensioner is available as a part of the [OpenEDM-wire-machine design](https://github.com/OpenEDM/OpenEDM-wire-machine)

## Operation principle

First, this is how the wire runs:

Next, let's take a look at the wire tensioner's main components:
